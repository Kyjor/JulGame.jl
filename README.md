## What is JulGame?

JulGame is an open-source game engine meant for creating 2D games (and 3d games... eventually) using the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/). JulGame uses [SDL2](https://github.com/JuliaMultimedia/SimpleDirectMediaLayer.jl/), and [CImGui](https://github.com/Gnimuc/CImGui.jl) for the editor. The plan for 3d will be to use OpenGL.

## Why did I make it?

Because I find Julia interesting and I've always wanted to create a game engine. I would like to see a game dev scene around it as there isn't much of one now. I am not a Julia programmer (nor an experienced game engine creator), so I am sure there is a lot I am doing wrong. If you see anything that I can fix, please just let me know with a discussion or an issue.

## Why JulGame?

I thought that JulGame would be a great play on Pygame. I also think it just rolls off the tongue. Also, I recently found out that "Jul" is the etymological root of ‚Äú[jolly](https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/j%C3%B3l#Icelandic)‚Äù, so it makes for a great pun :)

## How to get started?

`] add JulGame` for the latest in the package manager

`] add https://github.com/Kyjor/JulGame.jl` for main - RECOMMENDED as this should be the most stable branch.

`] add https://github.com/Kyjor/JulGame.jl#develop` for develop, which will have bleeding edge changes.

Either download the latest release of the editor, or run it by navigating to `JulGame\src\editor\Editor\src\Editor.jl`
and run `julia Editor.jl`

## How do you use it?

Once you have the editor open, download the [example](https://github.com/Kyjor/JulGame-Example), unzip it, and then open the folder with the editor. 

üî¥Warningüî¥ Save often! The editor may crash! We do attempt to save a backup for unhandled errors though. But it is better to be safe than sorry.

### How do you run your scene?
Navigate to your project, and cd to the directory with `Run.jl`, and run `julia Run.jl`, and it should start!

## Inspirations/Credits
This is a list of references that I used in order to get JulGame where it is, along with people who inspired the creation of this (who you should definitely check out!)
- [Solar Lune](https://github.com/SolarLune/tetra3d), who is creating a 3d renderer. This format for the readme is also referencing theirs.
- [Coder Gopher](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfiC4q3AahU4Io-s83-CIbQ), who has tutorials that helped me get started with SDL.
- [Lazy foo](https://lazyfoo.net/), who has tutorials that brought me the rest of the way with SDL.
- and so many others who I will note some of in the future :)

## Games Made With JulGame
Here I will be keeping a list for the first **original** games created with JulGame by external contributors (aka not me). If you would like to see games that I have made, check them out at https://kyjor.itch.io

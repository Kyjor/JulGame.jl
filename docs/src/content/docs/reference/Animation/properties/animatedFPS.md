`animatedFPS` stands for "animated Frames Per Second". It is a measure of how many unique consecutive images, or frames, are displayed each second in an animation. 

A higher `animatedFPS` value means more frames are shown per second, resulting in smoother and more realistic motion. Conversely, a lower `animatedFPS` value means fewer frames per second, which can result in choppier or more stilted motion.
